# [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) - Urban Development project
# README

## Purpose
This project is creating a data visualization tool, so that users can tell their own stories about urban change.

## Technology
The web site, [PlotPDX](http://www.plotpdx.com/prototype/), is a Single-Page Application (SPA), implemented in JavaScript. The application running in a browser accesses data from RESTful web services. See the [urbandev-backend](https://github.com/hackoregon/urbandev-backend) source repository for information about the [urbandev-backend web services](http://ec2-52-88-193-136.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/services/).

The browser application is based on the [BootLeaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf) template. It uses several JavaScript frameworks:

* [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/): "an open-source JavaScript library
for mobile-friendly interactive maps."
* [leaflet-groupedlayercontrol](https://github.com/ismyrnow/Leaflet.groupedlayercontrol): "Leaflet layer control with support for grouping overlays together."
* [taffy](http://taffydb.com): "The JavaScript Database ... that brings database features into your JavaScript applications."
* [moment](http://momentjs.com/): "Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript."
* [daterangepicker](http://www.daterangepicker.com/): "A JavaScript component for choosing date ranges. Designed to work with the Bootstrap CSS framework."

## Background
This repository was created during the Fall 2015 season of [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/). There had been some prior work on the [PlotPDX project](https://github.com/PlotPDX), but the [urbandev-frontend](https://github.com/hackoregon/urbandev-frontend) repository where you are now is the latest work on this project.
